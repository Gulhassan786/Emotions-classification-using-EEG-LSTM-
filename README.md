# Detecting Emotions Using EEG Waves

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect human emotions using EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals. The project employs advanced machine learning and deep learning models, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, to classify different emotional states. The applications include healthcare, mental health monitoring, and enhancing human-computer interaction.

## Features
- **EEG Signal Acquisition**: Pre-processed EEG data used as input for classification.
- **Emotion Classification**: Implemented LSTM models to capture temporal dependencies in EEG signals.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.
- **Deep Learning Techniques**: Applied LSTM for time-series data analysis, achieving promising results in emotion detection.
- **Test Accuracy**: Achieved 98.281% on test data.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib
